The program simulates a battleship game between two players. 
There are two boards with ships placed on them. Next to the board, there are two buttons.
When the button "Next Move" is hit, a move by one of the players is simulated, and shown by a dark point on the opponent's grid.
The button "New Simulation" resets the grids, and places new ships.


Assumptions:  
-Grids on which players put their ships are fixed at a size of 10x10 cells.  
-Each player has 5 ships with lengths of l = {5,4,3,3,2}  
-ships can not touch each other (niether on the sides, nor diagonally)
